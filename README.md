# studentsandgroups

The program allows you to work with a student database read from a text file (input.txt is an example).
Note the peculiarity of filling in the input file

This version of the program has the ability to manually add information about the person
Updates to the output mechanism and implementation of deletion are planned

## Warning!
Some features of the code come from the requirements of the instructor. For example, I see no reason to use HashSet<T> instead of Dictionary<T>
